The snake game is a classic, retro-style video game where players control a serpent on a grid, navigating it to consume food items and grow longer while avoiding collisions with its own tail or boundaries. With a simple yet engaging gameplay mechanic, the snake game tests players' strategic thinking and reflexes as they strive to achieve the highest possible score
